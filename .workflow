-- This gets current page in Safari and puts a markdown link the clipboard
-- VERY handy if you do lots of note taking. I gather lots of urls and take notes in markdown
-- I wanted a way to grab pages and put them in notes that looked nice and
-- compact and useful.
-- Links will look like this:
-- DOMAIN - TITLE
-- with title trimmed to a legth specified by titleDisplayLength
-- packaged as a service so it can be assigned a keyboard shortcut
-- Lots of complexity for something only a little bettern than "Command-L That will highlight the URL field Then just select Command-C to copy."
-- But I still use the 20x per day.
